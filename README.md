# Image-segmentation
This project demonstrates image segmentation using Python. The segmentation process calculates pixel differences for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nodes. The Union-Find algorithm is used to merge and segment the image, with each segment assigned a unique color for visualization.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
- Loading and converting an image to a 2D array.
- Calculating absolute differences (weights) for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nodes.
- Sorting the pixel differences based on weights.
- Using the **Union-Find algorithm** for merging segments.
- Assigning unique colors to each segment.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** 
- **Processing Software**: For image processing tasks
- **VS Code IDE**

## Dataset

The project uses any image that can be loaded and converted into pixel data for segmentation.
